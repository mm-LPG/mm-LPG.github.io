## 640.1 General Project Criteria
1. **Purpose:** The Parks & Wildlife Code authorizes the Department to provide financial assistance to local governments for the acquisition and/or development of public recreation areas and facilities. Such assistance shall be on a matching basis to a maximum fifty (50) percent of the total project related allowable costs, with the exception of Community Outdoor Outreach Project grants which may reimburse up to 100% of sponsor costs.
2. **Permanent Public Park & Recreation Dedication:** All areas receiving program assistance shall be dedicated for public park and recreation use in perpetuity, with the exception of leased properties (see Section 24.007 of the Texas Parks & Wildlife Code). Leased areas shall be dedicated for public park and recreation use for the term of the lease only. No property acquired or developed with program assistance shall be converted to other than public park and recreation uses without the approval of the Department and the substitution of other park and recreation properties of at least equal fair market value and equivalent park and recreation usefulness (see Chapter 675.9.3).
3. **Project Proposals:** The Department has the initial prerogative and responsibility for determining the scope and effort involved in a project proposal. A project can be designed as follows: 1) acquisition and/or development work at one site or 2) acquisition and/or development work, sponsored by a single local unit of government, at several non-contiguous sites.
   A project proposal, except in the most unusual circumstances, should embrace only those efforts that can be accomplished within a three-year period (subject to extension).
4. **Types of Projects:**
   A. Acquisition: Includes the acquisition of land and waters or partial rights to them.
   B. Development: Includes the development of certain recreation activity and support facilities needed by the public for recreation use of an area.
   C. Combined: Includes acquisition and development.
   D. Community Outdoor Outreach Program: Programmatic grants to local governments or not-for-profit organizations as outlined in Chapter 640.4.
   E. Regional Park: Large, regionally significant recreation areas comprised of urban intensive use areas and/or urban or rural park lands which serve urban areas, linear greenways, cultural resource areas, natural resource conservation areas, aquatic habitat, or surface water resource areas. These projects should leverage funds, support, and operations with the private sector, non-profits, educational entities, and other governmental entities where possible, but one local government must possess the authority to contract for matching funds with the Department.
   F. Facilities Transfers: Grants to effectuate the transfer by the Parks & Wildlife Commission of Department owned or operated and maintained facilities to a political subdivision for operation and maintenance. Transfer must be mutually agreed to as evidenced by written agreement, and grants may include park improvements, renovations, and temporary operation funds.
5. **Multiple-Purpose Projects:** Multi-purpose projects which involve uses other than recreation may be eligible for assistance. The sponsor must include a careful and complete justification and explanation with each proposal. Two general types of multiple-purpose projects are eligible for assistance:

    A. Projects in which a specifically designated portion of the multiple-purpose area or facility will be used primarily for recreation and/or recreation support, such as picnicking facilities adjacent to a new public reservoir. Program assistance is limited to the designated recreation area and/or facility and support facilities.
    B. Projects which will provide identifiable recreation benefits as a whole, as opposed to specific segments of it. For example, a water impoundment constructed primarily for flood control might also have important recreation benefits. In such a case, at the Department's discretion, assistance might be made available only for the portion of the cost, on a pro rata basis, of the facility which is clearly attributable to recreation above and beyond the facility's cost for its non-recreation function.
   
   The proposal must fully disclose the nature and extent of other uses and the relationship of the proposed recreation project to the total area and development.
6. **Assistance from Other Agencies:** Project proposals submitted to the Department for program assistance may also be submitted to other public agencies for aid. The local matching share of an approved project may consist of other financial assistance only where the statutory provisions of the subsequent grants program explicitly allows recipients to use such assistance to match state funds with state funds or federal funds with federal funds (see Chapter 670.1.6). The application to the Department should describe any such submissions or awards.
7. **Control and Tenure:** For lands included in a project proposal, the project sponsor must have title or adequate control and tenure of the project area in order to provide reasonable assurances that a conversion under Chapter 640.1.2. provisions will not occur without Department approval. Copies of the property titles, leases, easements, or other appropriate documents must be submitted for state inspection.
   A. Property that is proposed for acquisition and/or development and which is subject to reversionary interests upon discontinuation of the recreation use may be eligible to receive program assistance. The Department's determination in this regard will rest on the compatibility of uses proposed by the project sponsor with that stipulated in the reversionary clause and receipt of satisfactory assurances from the sponsor that the property so assisted will be replaced in accord with specific Chapter 640.1.2. provisions applicable to such future conversion should the reversionary interest be exercised.
   
   Such assurances are contained in the General Provisions of the Project Agreement and may also apply to termination provisions included in leases and special use permits, provided such revocation is not at the sole discretion of the lessor.
   
   B. Properties subject to outstanding interests, such as mineral rights that, if exercised, may not be compatible with the continued viable use of the area for recreation, may also be agreed to under certain specific conditions. The Department will agree to such a future conversion based upon a sponsor's agreement that these lands will be replaced in accord with Chapter 640.1.2. provisions. This specific assurance provision is contained in the General Provisions of the Project Agreement.
   
   Such concerns are only with those reversionary rights or outstanding interests that, should they occur or be exercised, would result in the project area not being viable for continued public recreation use as determined by the Department at the time of project submission and where the sponsor certifies and the Department agrees that the possibility of the reversionary interest or outstanding rights being exercised is remote. These decisions will be made on a case by case basis. When significant outstanding rights are involved, the project application will also contain an opinion from local counsel that the sponsor has the authority to enter into a grant contract which may require the provision of replacement land. Other rights and interests which, if exercised, will not adversely affect the recreation utility or viability of the area may be excepted from Chapter 640.1.2. provisions purview upon recommendation of the sponsor and concurrence by the Department.
   
   C. Waiver of Retroactivity. A sponsor may assume legal control of a site for which grant assistance is being sought prior to grant approval only if they have obtained a Waiver of Retroactivity under the guidelines as shown in Chapter 670.1.4.B.

8. **Leasing of Program Assisted Lands:** A project sponsor may provide for the operation of a program assisted facility by leasing the facility to a private organization or individual. As the principal grantee, the sponsor is ultimately accountable for assuring compliance with the applicable program requirements and therefore the delegation or transfer of certain responsibilities to sub-grantees or lessees does not relieve the sponsor of its compliance burden. Accordingly, the sponsor must irrevocably agree to provide suitable replacement property should the public use of the leased facility be restricted or the recreation resource be compromised (see also Chapter 675.9.5. Post-Compliance Responsibilities and Conversion Guidelines).
    
    All lease documents for the operation of program assisted projects by private organizations or individuals must address the following:

    A. In order to protect the public interest, the sponsor must have a clear ability to periodically review the performance of the lessee and terminate the lease if its terms and the provisions of the grant agreement, including standards of maintenance, public use, and accessibility are not met.
    B. The document should clearly indicate that the leased area is to be operated by the lessee for public recreation purposes in compliance with program provisions and implementing guidelines.
    C. The document should require that the area be identified as being publicly owned and operated as a public recreation facility in all signs, literature and advertising and that the lessee be identified as such so as not to mislead the public into believing that the area is privately owned. Signs should also be posted identifying the facility as being open to the public in accord with Chapter 675.3.
    D. The document should require that all fees charged by the lessee to the public must be competitive with similar private facilities.
    E. The document should make clear that compliance with all civil rights and accessibility legislation (e.g., Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Americans with Disabilities Act) is required, and that compliance will be indicated by signs posted in visible public areas, statements in public information brochures, etc.
9.  **Use of Existing Public Land for Matching Purposes:** Existing publicly owned lands can only be used as a part of the local matching share of a project if such land has never been dedicated, platted, managed, used, or acquired for public park and recreation use.

## 640.2 Acquisition Criteria

1. **Types of Acquisition:** Acquisition of lands and waters for public recreation, including new areas or additions to existing parks, forests, wildlife areas, beaches, and other similar areas dedicated to recreation may be eligible for assistance. Acquisition can be by fee simple title or by whatever lesser rights will insure the desired public use. The types of acquisitions that are eligible for assistance include, but are not limited to:
   
    A. Areas with frontage on oceans, rivers, streams, lakes, estuaries, and reservoirs that will provide water-based public recreation opportunities, or the acquisition of water bodies themselves.
    B. Land for creating water impoundments to provide water-based public recreation opportunities.
    C. Areas that provide special recreation opportunities, such as floodplains, wetlands, open space, and areas adjacent to scenic highways.
    D. Natural areas and preserves and outstanding scenic areas where the objective is to preserve the scenic or natural values, including areas of physical or biological importance and wildlife areas. These areas must be open to the general public for recreation use to the extent that the natural attributes of the areas will not be seriously impaired or lost.
    E. Land within urban areas for day-use picnic areas, neighborhood playgrounds, and tot lots; areas adjacent to school playgrounds and competitive nonprofessional sports facilities; as well as more generalized parklands.
    F. Land and areas for the construction of indoor facilities and related support and infrastructure facilities.
    G. Permanent recreation use easements or similar devices which will insure the desired public access, use and permanent recreation dedication.
    H. Dedication of publicly owned non-parkland may be considered acquisition if the land has never been dedicated, platted, managed, or acquired for public park and recreation use.
2. **Activities Covered:** Areas acquired may serve a wide variety of recreation activities including, but not limited to: driving and walking for pleasure, sightseeing, swimming and other water sports, fishing, picnicking, nature study, boating, camping, horseback riding, bicycling, and other sports and activities.
3. **Acquisition of Structures:** Acquisition projects may include structures and impoundments which: (a) are to be used primarily for recreation or recreation support activities or (b) are a part of the recreation area to be acquired, and are to be removed or demolished or drained in the case of impoundments (see Chapter 675.2 for methods of evaluation).
4. **Means of Acquisition:** Acquisition of lands and waters, or interests therein may be accomplished through purchase, eminent domain, transfer, by gift, or by mandatory dedication.
5. **Reservations and Rights Not Acquired:** Reservations and rights held by others are permissible only if it is determined that the recreation purposes and environment would not be significantly affected. The project sponsor shall list all outstanding rights or interests held by others and display them on the project boundary map [see Chapter 660.2.5]. Further, the environmental information submitted to the Department on the project must explain how these outstanding rights are to be dealt with to assure that the recreation interests and the environment will not be affected significantly (see Chapter 650.2).
6. **Acquisition for Delayed Development:**
   A. Program assistance may be available to acquire property for which the development of recreation facilities is planned at a future date. In the interim between acquisition and development the property should be open for those public recreation purposes which the land is capable of supporting or which can be achieved with a minimum public investment. Non-recreation uses such as agriculture occurring on the property at the time of acquisition may continue for up to 3 years, contingent upon approval by the Department. In this case the project sponsor shall not receive payment on the project until the non-recreation use is terminated.
   B. If development will be delayed for more than two years from the date of acquisition, the project sponsor shall include the following information in the project application:

    (1) Why immediate acquisition of the property is necessary.
    (2) What facilities will be developed and when such development will occur.
    (3) What, if any, non-recreation uses will be continued on the property and when such non-recreation uses will be terminated.
    (4) The type of public recreation access that will be provided during the interim period.
    (5)
7. **Acquisition Which Will Not Be Assisted:**
    A. Acquisition of historic sites and structures. Exceptions may be made only when it is demonstrated clearly that the acquisition is primarily for recreation purposes and that the historic aspects are a corollary to the primary recreation purposes. This exclusion need not prevent the consideration of projects calling for acquisition of real property interests contiguous to or near historic sites and structures which meet priority recreation needs. Compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code - Revised August 30, 1995 is required for all acquisitions (see Chapter 650.4.).
    B. Acquisition of museums and sites to be used for museums or primarily for archeological excavations.
    C. Acquisition of land to help meet a public school's minimum site size requirement, as established by state or local regulations will not receive program assistance.
    D. Acquisition of areas and facilities designed to be used primarily for semi-professional and professional arts and athletics.
    E. Acquisition of areas and facilities to be used solely for game refuges or fish production purposes. However, such areas and facilities may be eligible if they will be open to the public for general compatible recreation, or if they directly serve priority public recreation needs.
    F. Acquisition of railroad "hardware", trestles, stations, yards, and the like, if such are to be used for the commercial operation of railroad trains.
    G. Acquisition of sites containing luxury lodges, motels, cabins, and similar elaborate facilities which are to be operated by the sponsor or a concessionaire to serve the public with food and sleeping quarters.
    H. Agricultural land primarily for agricultural purposes.
    I. Areas for which the primary purpose of the acquisition is for non-recreational uses such as an area to be impounded or excavated to serve as a future public water supply.
    J. Lands already within the public domain which were either dedicated, platted, managed or acquired for park and recreation use.
8. **Uniform Relocation and Acquisition:** All acquisitions with program assistance must be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of Public Law 91-646, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended.
9.  **Acquisition Procedures:** All acquisitions with program assistance must follow appraisal guidelines and acquisition procedures included in Chapter 675.2.

## 640.3 Development Criteria
1. **General:** Financial assistance may be available to provide most facilities necessary for the use and enjoyment of recreation areas. Development projects may consist of basic recreation facilities to serve the general public provided that the funding of such a project is in the public interest, in accord with local planning, and endorsed by the applicable regional planning council. In addition, development projects are subject to all other conditions, policies, and regulations included in the Grants Manual.
2. **Project Scope:** A development project may consist of one improvement or a group of related improvements designed to provide basic facilities for recreation, including facilities for access, safety, health, and protection of the area, as well as those required for the use of the area. Furthermore, a project may consist of the complete or partial development of one area, such as a local park or a city playground, or it may consist of a series of developments on a number of geographically separated areas. In all cases, the project must be a logical unit of work to be accomplished in a specific time frame. Ineligible facilities to be funded through sources other than the grant program may be included in the development concept plan of a project, however; the development of such ineligible facilities on lands acquired and/or developed with program assistance will be allowed only if they do not constitute a conversion under Chapter 675.9.3.
   
   Funding of development project proposals may cover construction, renovation, site planning, demolition, site preparation, architectural/professional services, and similar activities essential for the proper conduct of the project.
3. **Design Criteria:** Plans for the development of land and/or facilities should be based on the needs of the public, the expected use, and the type and character of the project area. Facilities should be attractive for public use and generally be consistent with the environment. Plans and specifications for the improvements/facilities should be in accord with established engineering and architectural practices. Emphasis should be given to the health and safety of users, accessibility to the general public, and the protection of the recreation and natural values of the area. All facilities developed with program assistance must be designed in conformance with the regulations issued by the Texas Department of Licensing & Regulation, under the Architectural Barriers Act, codified as Article 9102, Texas Civil Statutes, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (PL 101-336).
4. **Ownership and Control of Project Lands:**
    A. Fee Simple Title and Easements. Facilities may be developed on land and water owned in fee simple title by the sponsor, or where ownership of less-than-simple fee interests, such as easements, provides permanent control of the property commensurate with the proposed development.
    B. Leased Properties. No approval will be given for the development of facilities on leased land unless the following requirements are met:

        (1) The project site is leased from another public agency; and
        (2) The lease period is for 25 years or more for most projects, or 40 years or more for aquatic or indoor facilities; and
        (3) The lease is non-revocable; and
        (4) Leased facilities are operated free from discrimination, pursuant to program guidelines; and
        (5) Appropriate signage is posted informing the public when the facility is available for general use and when it is reserved/programmed for other uses.
5. **Guidelines for Eligible Recreation Facilities:** Development projects may include but are not limited to the following facility types:
    
    A. Sports and Playfields. Including fields, courts and other spaces used in competitive and individual sports. Such as baseball, softball, soccer and football, tennis courts, playgrounds and tot lots, golf courses, archery ranges, rodeo arenas, running tracks, and other similar facilities (see 640.3.5.L. and 640.3.7.A.).

    B. Picnic Facilities. Including tables, BBQ grills, fireplaces, shelters, and other facilities related to family or group picnic sites.

    C. Trails. Including the development and marking of overlooks, turnouts and trails for nature walks, hiking, bicycling, horseback riding, exercising, motorized vehicles and other trail activities.

    D. Swimming Facilities. Including swimming beaches, pools, wave pools, wading pools, spray pools, lifeguard towers, bathhouses and other similar facilities.

    E. Boating Facilities. Including most facilities related to boating, sailing, canoeing, kayaking, sculling and other boating activities. Such facilities include, but are not limited to, docks, berths, floating berths secured by buoys or similar services, launching ramps, breakwaters, mechanical launching devices, boat lifts, boat storage, sewage pumpout facilities, fuel depots, water and sewer hookups, restrooms, showers, electricity and parking areas.
    
    Motorized boating facilities, however, may only be considered for program assistance if the sponsor can certify that funds have been requested and denied through the State Boat Ramp Program and/or the State Pumpout Program.
    
    Regardless of whether assistance is requested for motorized or non-motorized boating, assistance will not be provided for operational equipment such as buoys, ropes, life jackets, or boats.

    F. Camping Facilities. Including tables, fireplaces, restrooms, information stations, snack bars, utility outlets and other facilities needed for camping by tent, trailer or camper. Cabins or group camps of simple austere design and accessible to the general public in an equitable manner are eligible. Group camps designated for specific groups or for which specific groups will be given priority access are not eligible. Lodges, motels and luxury cabins are not eligible.

    G. Golf Courses. Including construction, irrigation, landscaping, roads, parking, utilities, moderate clubhouses and maintenance facilities, and cart paths.

    H. Exhibit Facilities. Including exhibit or interpretive facilities that provide opportunities for the observation or interpretation of natural resources located on the recreation site or in its immediate surrounding areas. This includes small demonstration farms, arboretums, aquariums, nature exhibits, nature interpretive centers, kiosks, and other similar facilities. However, exhibit areas will not be assisted if they function primarily for academic, historic, economic, entertainment or other non-recreational purposes. This restriction includes convention facilities, commemorative exhibits, fairgrounds, archeological research sites, and other non-recreational facilities. The development of nature and geological interpretive facilities which go beyond interpreting the project site and its immediate surrounding area are not eligible.

    I. Spectator Facilities. Including amphitheaters, bandstands and modest seating areas related to playfields and other eligible facilities, provided the facility is not designed primarily for professional or semiprofessional arts or athletics, nor intercollegiate or interscholastic sports. Some bleachers or other modest seating areas are encouraged to be incorporated where needed into eligible recreation facilities to serve the handicapped, elderly and other nonparticipant in the facility's major recreation activity. Seating shall not be expanded solely to provide capacity for a limited number of special events.

    J. Community Gardens. Including land preparation, perimeter fencing, storage bins and sheds, irrigation systems, benches, walkways, parking areas, composting areas, and restrooms. Assistance is not available for fertilizer, seeds, tools, water hoses, nor gardens planned as commercial enterprises.

    K. Renovated Facilities. Including extensive renovation or redevelopment to bring a facility up to standards of quality, safety, accessibility and attractiveness suitable for public use, if the facility or area has deteriorated to the point where its usefulness is impaired or outmoded, or where it needs to be upgraded to meet public health and safety laws or requirements. However, such renovation is not eligible if the facility's deterioration is due to inadequate maintenance during the reasonable life of the facility.

    L. Handicapped Facilities. Including the adaptation of new or existing recreation facilities and support facilities for use by the handicapped (see Chapter 640.3.3.). However, recreation facilities to be used exclusively by the handicapped are not eligible unless such facilities are available to the general public or are part of a recreation area which serves the general public.

    M. Indoor Facilities. Including athletic and sport facilities, arts and craft facilities, meeting rooms, stages, nature centers, exhibit and interpretive space, senior citizen centers, indoor recreation equipment, aquatic/swimming facilities, and exercise rooms. Indoor facilities will be funded only through the Indoor Recreation Grants Program, but are ineligible for LWCF assistance.

6. **Guidelines for Eligible Support Facilities:**
    A. Public Use Facilities. Including support facilities needed by the public for recreation use of an area, such as roads, parking areas, utilities, sanitation systems, restroom buildings, visitor information centers, bathhouses, permanent spectator seating, walkways, concession stands, and equipment rental spaces. When appropriate, support facilities may be sheltered from the elements by providing a simple roof or cover. Informational materials and leaflets are not eligible.

    B. Operation and Maintenance Facilities. Facilities that support the operation and maintenance of the recreation resource on which they are located are eligible, such as maintenance buildings, storage areas, administrative offices, dams, erosion control works, fences, sprinkler systems and directional signs. Regional and area-wide maintenance facilities are eligible provided the project sponsor agrees to include those park and recreation areas served by the maintenance facility in the scope of the project agreement and under the conversion provisions of Chapter 640.1.2. (see Chapter 675.9.3.). However, an employee's residence and its furnishings are not eligible.

    C. Beautification. The beautification of a recreation area is eligible provided that it is not part of a regular maintenance program and if the site's condition is not due to inadequate maintenance. This includes landscaping to provide a more attractive environment; the clearing or restoration of areas which have been damaged by natural disasters; the screening, removal, relocation or burial of overhead power lines; the dredging and restoration of publicly owned recreation lakes or boat basins; and measures necessary to mitigate negative environmental impacts.

    D. Indoor/Enclosed Facilities. Assistance for indoor recreation infrastructure and support facilities funded through the “Indoor Recreation Program” may include day care areas, kitchens and food preparation areas, locker rooms, rest rooms, parking lots, recreation center staff offices, and utilities. To be eligible, infrastructure and support facilities must be proposed as part of an eligible indoor recreation project and cannot be intended primarily for outdoor recreation use.
    
    Sponsors who wish to enclose Land and Water Conservation Fund assisted outdoor facilities to increase public use may do so at this time at sponsor expense only. No program funds may be used for professional design services or for improvements which are necessary to make the facility suitable for conversion to indoor use.

    E. Pro Rata Basis. Support facilities that exclusively serve ineligible facilities are not eligible. However, if support facilities will serve both eligible and ineligible facilities, as may be the case with roads and sewers, assistance may be provided on a pro rata basis for that portion of the support facility that will serve the eligible facilities, provided that the eligible facilities are subject to conversion provisions of Chapter 640.1.2.

    F. Roads. Roads constructed outside the boundaries of the recreation area or park are not eligible for program assistance.

    G. Equipment. Equipment required to make a recreation facility initially operational, and certain supplies and materials specifically required under State Health Department regulations may be eligible for assistance (see Chapter 670.3.4.D.).

    H. Relation to Project Proposal. Development projects in new or previously undeveloped recreation areas may not consist solely of support facilities, unless they are required for proper and safe use of an area which does not require additional recreation facilities (such as construction or restrooms at a public nature study area), or unless necessary recreation facilities are being developed concurrently with the program assisted support facilities, or unless necessary recreation facilities will be developed within a reasonable period of time. In the latter two cases, the project agreement must include a provision that the non-program assisted recreation facilities are to be completed within a certain time frame agreeable to the Department and that if they are not, program monies will be refunded.

    I. Energy Conservation Elements. The energy conservation elements of an eligible recreation facility and its support facilities are eligible for program assistance. This includes but is not limited to solar energy systems, earth berms, window shading devices, energy lock doors, sodium vapor lights, insulation, low flow water devices, water catchment systems, and other energy efficient design methods and materials. In addition, power systems which minimize or eliminate a facility's use of petroleum and natural gas are eligible including, but not limited to, windmills, on-site water power systems, bio-conversion systems, and facilities required for the conversion of existing power systems to coal, wood, or other energy efficient fuels.
    
    J. Utilities. All utilities must be placed underground. Utilities constructed outside the boundaries of the recreation area or park are not eligible for program assistance.
7. **Facility Location:** Development projects may be located on lands and waters owned by or leased to the project sponsor (see Chapter 640.3.4.). In certain situations, however, the following conditions also apply:
   
    A. Public School Grounds. Recreation areas and facilities for coordinated use by the general public and by public schools, including colleges and universities, are eligible for program assistance, provided such facilities are not part of the normal and usual program and responsibility of the educational and athletic program requirements of a school. This policy does not preclude exclusive school use of certain facilities such as athletic fields, tennis courts, swimming pools, etc. at certain times for instruction or competition provided there is adequate public use at other times. Stadiums are not eligible for program assistance. The grant application must include a schedule of the time the facility will be available to the public. Additionally, adequate signs must be installed at the site, prior to final payment on the project, indicating when the recreation facilities are available to the general public.

    B. Tourist Areas. Recreation and support facilities may be located in primary or potential tourist market areas, provided their primary purpose is for public recreation as opposed to entertainment or economic development, and provided they do not create unfair competition with the private sector.

    C. Historic Sites. Recreation and support facilities may be located on historic sites or in conjunction with historic structures. This includes picnic areas, walkways and trails on a historic property as well as visitor centers oriented to the facilities and environment. However, the restoration or preservation of historic structures is not eligible. In all cases, the project must be in accord with the Texas Antiquities Code - Revised September 1, 1987 (see Chapter 650.4.).
8. **Guidelines for Sheltered/Covered Outdoor Facilities:** For the purpose of the program, sheltered or covered facilities include those facilities which are generally open air, not fully enclosed, with a roof overhead. Sheltered or covered facilities are eligible for assistance and are not considered indoor facilities. The sheltering of play courts, picnic facilities, etc. is permissible under program guidelines.
9. **Development Which Will Not Be Assisted:** Development projects which do not have a well defined objective are not eligible. Projects which do not directly contribute to public recreation activities are not eligible. Support facilities which are not directly related to public recreation are also not eligible. Projects for which the sponsor cannot demonstrate full legal control of the property proposed for development are not eligible for assistance.Generally, development assistance will not be made available for the following facilities:
    
    A. Restoration/Preservation of Historic Structures. The restoration and renovation of historic structures are not eligible for grant assistance. Public recreation facilities and support facilities in conjunction with historical structures or sites may, however, be eligible for assistance when in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code (Revised 9/1/87) if the development is adjacent to or on a site listed (or eligible to be listed) as a State Archeological Landmark.

    B. Areas/Facilities To Be Used Primarily For Professional or Semiprofessional Arts and Athletics. Such as stadiums, amphitheaters, and rodeo arenas.

    C. Amusement Facilities. Such as merry-go-rounds, Ferris wheels, miniature railroads, pioneer towns, convention facilities, and commemorative exhibits.

    D. Employee Residences and Furnishings.

    E. Construction/Renovation of Lodges, Motels or Luxury Cabins.

    F. Support Facilities for Non-eligible Facilities. If the support facility will serve both eligible and non-eligible facilities, assistance may be provided on a pro-rated basis for that portion of the facility which will support the public recreation activities.

    G. Marinas and Related Support Facilities.

    H. Community College/University and Convention Facilities.

    I. Parks and Recreation Department Offices or Headquarters.

    J. Head Start Program and Health Clinics.

    K. Golf and Tennis Pro-Shops.

    L. Conservatory and Garden Centers.

    M. Libraries and Recycling Centers.

    N. Police and Fire Substations.

    O. Visitor Information Centers and Chamber of Commerce Offices.

    P. Some facilities which are not eligible for grant assistance may be constructed in a fund assisted area if they are compatible with the public recreation uses of the area. Department approval must be received prior to the development of non-recreational facilities within program assisted areas. Questions regarding eligibility should be directed to the Department.
## 640.4 Community Outdoor Outreach Program Criteria

1. **Purpose:** The Texas Parks & Wildlife Code authorizes the Department to provide financial assistance to local governments and non-profit organizations for recreation, conservation, or education programs for underserved populations to encourage and implement increased access to and use of parks, recreational areas, cultural resource sites or areas, and open space areas by underserved populations.
   
2. **Project Proposals:** The Department has the initial prerogative and responsibility for determining the scope involved in a project proposal. A project may be designed as follows:
   A. An outdoor recreation program which involves the Department’s programs or facilities, or
   B. An outdoor educational program with curriculum involving the Department’s programs or facilities, or
   C. An outdoor outreach activity that involves the Department’s programs or facilities.

3. **Types of Projects:**
    A. Outdoor Education.
    B. Outdoor Recreation.
    C. Wildlife/Nature/Environmental Education.
    D. Outdoor Recreational Safety.

4. **Assistance from Other Agencies:** Project proposals submitted to the Department for program assistance may also be submitted to other agencies or foundations for aid. Although no matching funds are required for the CO-OP programs, financial assistance from other agencies and foundations may be used towards the sponsor’s contribution to the project.
